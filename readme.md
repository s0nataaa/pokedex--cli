## About This Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey in working with APIs for the first time. It was developed with the assistance of AI to help me understand the fundamentals of:
- Making HTTP requests to external APIs
- JSON data parsing and manipulation
- Error handling in API calls
- Building interactive command-line applications
